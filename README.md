# Personalized Healthcare Recommendation System

This project is a Personalized Healthcare Recommendation System developed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Flask. It is designed to assist users in managing their health effectively by providing personalized recommendations based on their symptoms. Users can input their symptoms, and the system utilizes NLP techniques to predict potential diseases and offers detailed descriptions to enhance understanding. Additionally, it provides a comprehensive suite of recommendations, including precautionary measures, suggested medications, tailored workout routines, and customized diet plans to support recovery and overall well-being. Powered by Flask, the system offers a user-friendly interface, making it accessible and easy to use for individuals seeking reliable health advice. This tool promotes early diagnosis, proactive healthcare management, and serves as a supplementary resource for symptom evaluation and disease management.
